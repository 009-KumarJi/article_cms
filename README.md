# Article CMS Backend

This repository encompasses the backend architecture for an Article Content Management System (CMS) featuring user roles, authentication, and CRUD operations.

## User Roles

The system defines three roles with different permissions:
- **Admin:** Full access to Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations.
- **Moderator:** Read and update access.
- **User:** Read-only access.

## Features

### User Authentication
- Secure password storage with hashing (bcrypt).
- JWT-based authentication.
- User password encryption.
- Cookies/Sessions management.

### Role Management
- Middleware for role-based access control (RBAC).

### CRUD Operations
- Efficient handling of task creation, retrieval, updates, and deletions.
- Search functionality for users and articles based on keywords.
- API endpoints for CRUD operations on an "articles" collection.
  - **Admin:** Can create, read, update, and delete articles.
  - **Moderator:** Can read and update articles.
  - **User:** Can only read articles.

### Backend
- Node.js & Express.js: Develop the server-side logic.
- APIs: Create RESTful APIs for handling authentication, articles management, and user roles.
- Authenticated API calls.
